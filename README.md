# cocktail_recommender
A python data project which accepts a spirit as an input and produces cocktail recipes with that particular spirit.

With this project, I wanted to try to create a cocktail recommender. The user can input a certain spirit, such as rum, and the program will output all cocktail names that include rum as an ingregient.
